This project focuses on the Airbnb house listings in New York City. I have made a dashboard out of some of the top findings and have included them into the final worksheet.

Insights : 

1. Williamsburg is the most expensive neighbourhood in NYC with Airbnb listings worth upto $600K. 
2. Marble hill in Manhattan has the lowest pricing for a listing worth $1070.
3. June is the highest month of the year where maximum airbnbs are listed. It is probably because most of them are on vacation during that time.
4. 44% of the listings are based in Manhattan which is a hotspot for all visitors.
5. The Average price for an entire home/apartment in Manhattan is $249.
6. Brooklyn & Breakfast - a host in brooklyn has receieved the highest number of reviews for their listing.
7. 2019 saw a huge jump in the reviews based on listings and it was the highest with 1M reviews.
